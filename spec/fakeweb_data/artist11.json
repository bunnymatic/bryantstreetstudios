With a grandmother who painted landscapes, a photographer for a Father and the daughter of Sallie Middleton as her best friend, art was omnipresent and encouraged in her formative years.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 2003, after 15 years as a Costume Designer in the film industry, Sevilla was inspired to return to painting after an intense creative awakening on Palatine Hill in Rome. The work she makes today isn\u2019t far from the original inspiration there, just being constantly refined and focused.\r\n\r\nSevilla currently lives in San Francisco, and works in the vibrant artistic community at the 1890 Bryant St. Studios.\r\n","studionumber":null,"lat":37.7486,"twitter":"http://twitter.com/SevillaGranger","artist_id":11},"studio_id":4,"myspace":"","image_width":1559,"profile_image":"artistdata/11/profile/profile.jpg","phone":"","firstname":"Sevilla","facebook":"http://www.facebook.com/sevilla.granger","studionumber":null,"login":"sevilla","twitter":"http://twitter.com/SevillaGranger","state":"active","email":"sevilla.granger@example.com"}}
