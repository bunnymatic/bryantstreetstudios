        Tunney is a professional photographer who lives and works in San Francisco.
        She has been voraciously making pictures since she was given her first camera
        in 1979.\n\nTrish received a Masters Degree in Engineering and spent 15 years
        working as a Computer Engineer. When she left her first career to pursue photography
        professionally, her extensive technical background made for a natural progression
        from the wet darkroom to digital photography where she has also become a master
        fine art printer.\n\nHer photography is about shadows and contrast more than
        objects. Because of this, the quality of light is crucial. She seeks out the
        directional light of early day or early evening where colors, both light and
        dark, are at their most exaggerated. She is drawn to bits of urban decay and
        endeavors to reveal the beauty that may be overlooked by the casual viewer.
        She has a \"found object\" aesthetic to her work where she will not manipulate
        the scene she is photographing either before or after the capture.\n\nTrish
        has enjoyed success and notoriety as both a fine art and a commercial photographer.
        You may see her work in numerous galleries around the San Francisco Bay Area
        and she has private collectors worldwide.","blog":"trishtunney.blogspot.com","city":"San

        \r\nPainting, mixed media, and installation, cultural and social issues                                             \r\n\r\n   Cynthia
        Tom is a visual multi-media artist, passionate about social justice, women\u2019s
        issues and playing with the accepted norm. Surrealism is the platform for
        her ideas to ruminate, take form, solutions discovered and color to inspire.\r\n\r\n    A
        seeker and philosopher about issues in her life, her ancestors and the community
        of women, she is inspired by dialog with friends and family, forming new themes
        and stories for her work. Collaboration and brainstorming are her playgrounds.
        \r\n\r\n    Her work has been exhibited at the Legion of Honor in San Francisco,
        the De Young Museum, and Yerba Buena Center for the Arts and various other
        galleries from New York to Washington to San Francisco. She lectures on her
        work, issues related to women, feminism in the arts and Asian American women
        in the arts, most recently for the College Art Association\u2019s Annual Conference.\r\n\r\n  Cynthia
        is included in the text book, \u201cWomen Artists of the American West\u201d,
        edited by Susan Ressler, University of Purdue and \u201cTraces of Migration
        and In-Betweeness: Poetics and Politics in Post-colonial Asian Women Artists\u201d,
        by Laura Fantone PhD, SF Art Institute ,University of Padua Press, Italy.  Cynthia
        is currently Board President, Exhibitions Curator and Programs Chair of AAWAA,
        Asian American Women Artists Association.\r\n    \r\n    A third-generation
        Chinese American, Cynthia draws inspiration from divergent\r\ncultures. The
        resulting contradictions are expressed in a variety of ways. Eastern and Western
        symbols often share space on the same canvas. Fanciful dresses portray a prophetic
        wish for people to raise their consciousness and her strong female images
        evoke a longing for freedom of expression and a life of choice.\r\n    Symbols,
        cues and clues fill her art, which is described as \u201cCultural Surrealism\u201d.\r\nCynthia\u2019s
        paintings and installations persuade us to look beyond the aesthetic--to challenge
        stereotypes and traditional roles, questioning paradigms and\r\nencourages
        our internal dialogue.\r\n_________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nSelected

        work is about the urban experience. \r\n\r\nNot the hipster coffee shops nor

        and honest, with a refreshing absence of the decorative trickery found on

        recent oil and mixed media paintings are driven by process and improvisation.
        The initial compositions are informed by photographs of cellular or satellite
        images chosen for their color and complexity, but I depart from the source
        imagery as a painting takes on a life of its own. Other compositions are improvised
        from their inception. Building upon material phenomena and accident, I consciously
        incorporate unpredictable elements into the work. In balancing spontaneous
        mark making and drips with controlled calligraphic line, I create structure
        and beauty from chaos and uncertainty. \r\n\r\nMy palette is connotative,
        evoking states that range from violent transformation to calm serenity. Building
        layer upon layer of color produces atmospheric depth that reinforces these
        sensations by implying history and location. \r\n\r\nPartly a meditation on
        light and form within macroscopic and microscopic worlds, my work is an intuitive
        reaction to the process of painting itself: an inward search for presence
        and immediacy. \r\n","blog":"","city":"San Francisco","created_at":"2009-12-17T10:07:53-08:00","facebook":"http://www.facebook.com/robertreed.art","flickr":"","id":12,"instagram":null,"lat":37.7632,"lng":-122.41,"max_pieces":20,"myspace":"","news":null,"open_studios_participation":"201010|201110|201210|201004|201104|201404|201204|201304|201511","pinterest":null,"street":"1890

        to make up for lost time and have been possessed ever since.  Having a chance

        to the flourish and indifference of the birds of San Francisco, with its endless

        Rodriguez is a self taught, Chicana artist. Originally from San Jose, she
        has been a resident of San Francisco for many years. Martha has a degree in
        Social Welfare from U.C. Berkeley and worked in the field of Public Health
        at the onset of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980\u2019s. She helped with researching
        the causes and effects of HIV during that time.\r\n\r\nWhen her son and daughter
        were born, she began to volunteer in their schools creating Chicano culture
        related art curriculum to share with the students. It was then that she began
        to explore her own art form making jewelry, crafts and painting.\r\n\r\nAlways
        intrigued by color, cultures, creativity and lifestyles, Martha continues
        to create one of a kind jewelry with an emphasis on bright colors, bead work
        and Dia de los Muertos/Frida Kahlo iconography. Her home accessories also
        highlight Latino icons with an assortment of crowns, crosses framed in shadow
        boxes. Martha''s paintings, also rich in color carry on the thread of Chicano
        themes and also explore the beauty of women\u2019s powerful bodies as a more
        natural alternative to the gaunt images seen in fashion magazines.\r\n\r\nIn
        life, Martha was diagnosed with Leukemia in 2010. As a cancer survivor, she
        lives each day enriched by the challenges she faces, every smile she receives
        and laugh she can share. She sees life as a myriad of bright colors she hopes
        to express in the artwork she creates.\r\n\r\n","blog":"http://estudiomartita.blogspot.com/","city":"San

        ME\r\n\r\nDiane Olivier lives and works in San Francisco with her daughter,
        Olivia and son Henry as well as their big black dog Bosco. Born in Rhode Island,
        she has been a resident since of California since 1990 and on full time staff
        at City College of San Francisco since 1991. She teaches Basic, Intermediate
        and Figure drawing every semester and hosts a South of France Drawing Workshop
        for two weeks each June as well as weekend workshops in the Bay Area.\r\n\r\nARTIST
        STATEMENT\r\n\r\nDrawing has always been my primary media, working with both
        traditional and nontraditional materials on scales ranging from small book
        size to mural size. My subject matter ranges from figurative, landscape and
        cityscapes to non-representational. The media ranges from charcoal to graphite,
        to full color pastels to non-traditional mixed media. The sense of touch between
        the tools and the paper and the immediacy of the mark are important element
        in my process. It is a dance between the eyes, the hand and the soul.\r\n\r\nSELECTED

        paintings reflect my interest the built environment, and the interplay between
        city life, nature and infrastructure. My work is greatly influenced by my
        career as a landscape architect, where I learned to appreciate the overlap
        of history, topography, cultures, and industry that occurs in an urban environment.
        Responding to certain sites that might otherwise be overlooked, whether industrial
        areas, old streetcars, or the urban street, I want to capture the appeal and
        life of these settings with the vibrancy of colors that is my foundation.
        My paintings are a reflection on the underlying aesthetic of the places we
        see, and often don''t see, in our world.\r\n\r\nI majored in Fine Art at Colorado
        College with an emphasis on landscape painting and earned my Masters in Landscape
        Architecture at University of California, Berkeley. I studied painting at
        L\u2019Ecole des Beaux Arts through the Cleveland Institute of Art, in Lacoste,
        France, at L\u2019Ecole des Beaux Arts in Aix-en-Provence, France, and at
        the Academy of Art University in San Francisco. I have shown my work in France,
        Colorado and the Bay Area. I am represented at Robert Allen Fine Art in Sausalito,

        Burlingame, a San Francisco native raised in Northeast Ohio, represents a
        third generation in a family of artists. His clean, abstract works have gained
        much attention in San Francisco, including commissions for many prominent
        Bay Area professionals. Since 1996 Jonah has been using his signature technique
        of painting with a squeegee and suspending each layer of paint in varnish
        to create paintings that harmonize within a high design environment. His work
        combines organic color textures with formal structural elements, which beg
        the viewer to imagine a world beyond the window his paintings provide.\r\n\r\nJonah
        Burlingame was born in the spring of 1968 in San Francisco. He grew up in
        Northeast Ohio where he attended Kent State University studying art history
        and graphic design. Having garnered awards and a strong following in the Midwest,
        he returned nearly thirty-five years later to pursue a career as an artist
        in the city he again calls his home. Jonah now resides in Glen Park with his
        wife and daughter where he continues to exhibit and gain prominence in the

        work is concerned with the relationship that exists between man-made structures
        and the natural environment, \r\neven if we are not always aware of it. As
        a society with our need for housing, workspace, energy, and transportation
        we expand into nature and use it - often destroying nature in the process.
        I wish to draw attention to the fact that our environment as we have created
        it has a significant influence on us. What makes us like or dislike a specific
        place or landscape? What makes us feel light and free when we are in an open
        space where we see a wide sky or a horizon line? What makes us enjoy certain
        public spaces, buildings, or cities? I explore these thoughts with abstract
        drawings. Lines, marks, patterns and geometric shapes build a drawing that
        may evoke emotions or raise awareness for the precariousness of our situation.
        For me, these drawings are focused meditations on environment, light, existing
        and imagined boundaries, and our shared human experience.","blog":"","city":"San

        \r\nPlease join me during my artist residency and exhibition at the de Young
        museum from July 31 to September 1 2013: \"The Art of Painting Music: Allegro
        (ma non troppo)\"\r\n\r\nMy abstract paintings are inspired by the lyrical
        qualities of music. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania with
        a degree in Biological Anthropology, I studied painting, drawing and sculpture
        at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and the  University of the Arts.\r\n\r\nI
        was Painter-in-Residence with the San Francisco Chamber Orchestra for 2010
        and 2012 and in 2009 I also had a painting residency with the The Music Institute
        of Chicago. Recent solo exhibitions in San Francisco have shown recent big
        band jazz-inspired paintings and solo piano music inspired work. SFMoMa\u2019s
        Artists Gallery included me in \u201cBanzai/Godzilla: Japanese Influences
        on American Artists\u201d in August 2007.  Earlier solo exhibitions include
        \u201c16 Atmospheres for piano and paint\u201d created in collaboration with
        pianist Rieko Aizawa for Pentimenti Gallery in Philadelphia in 2005. In 2003,
        the Philadelphia Museum of Jewish Art commissioned a series ,\u201cDreams
        and Prayers\u201d, inspired by Jewish Ukrananian cantorial music and contemporary
        music by Argentine composer Osvaldo Golijov. In 2002, my exhibition \u201cParallel
        Play: New Paintings, New Music\u201d was inspired by contemporary classical
        composers John Adams and Tina Davidson.\r\n\r\nBefore moving to San Francisco,
        I was Artist-in-Residence at the Philadelphia Museum of Art ( 2002). In 1999-2000
        I was commissioned to create a series of paintings for performances of The
        Philadelphia Orchestra at the Academy of Music to celebrate their centennial
        season. In early  2000 to 2005 I also directed and created  multimedia commissions
        for live symphony performances. Reviews and write-ups can be found in the
        Philadelphia Inquirer, ABC news, Philadelphia Style magazine, City Paper and
        WRTI\u2019s \u201cTempo\u201d magazine and on WRTI broadcasts.\r\n\r\nwww.peggygyulai.com\r\n","blog":"","city":"San

        work uses science and mass media as metaphor for our emotions about the inner
        chaos of our world. I aim to reflect the isolation of those who may be ignored
        or shy but still want to be seen. The beauty is there, waiting for be discovered,
        but we can not see it because we can not shed our prejudices.\r\n\r\nI see
        life as a big playground. My journalistic background allows me to explore
        even the most obnoxious situations and discover an untold history or astonishing
        image. Sometimes I get my epiphanies from the kitsch, because that\u2019s
        where the wisdom of the street is; in the garbage. That is why I feel attracted
        to conceptual ambiguities, aesthetic paradoxes and dark irony.\r\n\r\nMy work
        is feminine, but not necessary glamorous. It is something raw, mischievous
        but kind... sardonic laughter and a bit of smeared lipstick. Through that
        glass I explore topics like biology, science, ecology and social landscaping
        of consumption symbols, violence and prejudices. The use of erotic pics and
        car crashes in the Accidental Erotica series evokes both a visceral response
        and emotional dissonance.\r\n\r\nThe images of science in my artwork comes
        from the relation that I have with my own body. Long ago I got sick from stress.
        That made me wonder about the relation between emotions, human biology and
        environment. Art allowed me to see my body as a \u201cbeing\u201d -with autonomy-
        with whom I must live. I like to call that the ecology of the human biological
        process.\r\n\r\nI humanize abstract topics to allow the public to become more
        involved with his environment and them- selves, using their imagination. That
        is the direction I want to take: push the boundaries of the perception of
        our own bodies and their influence in our social relations and our own emotions
        and fears. \r\n\r\nAbout me\r\n\r\nAlthough I lives in San Francisco, I am
        from Venezuela, where I began to do art in 1998. I have a back- ground in
        literature and journalism that I use for enrich my art. I am the author of
        two poetry books. \r\n\r\nI exhibited in Miami, Minneapolis, Los Angeles,
        New York, Venezuela and Chile. Also, I exhibited in several venues and galleries
        in San Francisco Bay Area like Driftwood Salon, JellyFish Gallery, Somarts,
        MCCLA, Artist Television Artist (ATA\u2019s) and CityArt Gallery, as well
        I helped in the organization of MAPP: Mission Arts and Performing Projects.
        I am Artist In Residence at ArtSpan program 2010- 2011 (San Francisco). Usually  I
        work at my studio at Art Explosion, (2415 17th St. #147) in the Mission.\r\n\r\nNow
        I am preparing in a solo show in Miami, where I am exhibiting my \"Accidental
        Erotica\". Also, I just finished the illustration for the book \"Lauren Ipsum\",
        a bestseller in geek literature for children at Amazon. \r\n","blog":"http://ytaelena.com/#967700/BLOG","city":"San

        STATEMENT\nThe potencies of nature intrigue me, especially environments invisible
        to the naked eye. This recent series of paintings is based on the swimming
        world locked in a drop of pond water: zooplankton bouncing off one another,
        and the potential and kinetic energy harbored in this tiny environment. The
        scale shifts from microscopic to tangible. It\u2019s the intersection of the
        natural and the imaginary. Abstracted protozoa shapes jostle, float and grow
        in their own fluid world. The cells and simple pleuteus creatures are vessels
        with permeable and semi-permeable membranes. The membranes can be fragile
        drawings or substantial containers surrounding solid forms. I\u2019m captivated
        by gesture investigations of these quasi-biological forms and their evocative
        energy. I like to think of this environment as a teaming primordial soup with
        endless potential for positive growth.\n\nBIOGRAPHY\nI am a native of Virginia.
        I have attended the University of Virginia and have received a BFA from Virginia
        Commonwealth University. After many years working in advertising in New York
        City, I reside currently in San Francisco, CA, concentrating on painting.

        done a series of portraits based on found photographs. I love exploring the

        recently resumed my painting career after a ten year hiatus following the
        birth of my nine year old daughter.  I originally moved up to San Francisco
        to paint full time and get my MFA at San Francisco Art Institute, and I stayed
        because I fell in love with this little city.  I waitressed, painted, won
        a residency fellowship at the Millay Colony in upstate New York, showed around
        the country and internationally, and had a great gallery here in town.  Then
        I took ten years off.\r\nOver the last ten years, I have changed and my paintings
        have changed as well.  My mother said something to me last year as I was revving
        up to get my hands dirty again, \u201cDon\u2019t paint so personally, paint
        things that are more public.\u201d  That was the only suggestion that she
        had ever made about my work, except for objecting to all the nudes during
        my student days.  Then she added, \u201cSlow down\u201d and something else
        I cannot remember.  I didn\u2019t give her comments any further thought, but
        as my mind quieted in the studio I found that I am doing exactly what she
        said.  It is a first.\r\nI paint my everyday life here in San Francisco -
        the dogs, seagulls, pelicans.  I pick items that provide glimpses of all my
        favorite places, the Mission District, Bernal Heights and Fort Funston.  By
        juxtapositioning these images, I have fun creating new meaning and vague narratives.  I
        am still painting my private life, but with a more public and universal approach.\r\n","blog":"www.lanitanaka.blogspot.com","city":"San

        trying to explain about myself and my work, I realize that my motivation for
        painting is to experience an emotion, not merely depict a narrative. I love
        color, texture and composition, but the thing that really draws me to paint
        is the mood or memory or even the possibility of memory. I suppose I am a
        romantic in that I see optimism in pathos, rhythm in drudgery and shades of
        color in the gray between black and white. As a result, I envision wonderful
        things going on before or after I\u2019ve painted a scene as I relate emotionally
        to the characters that I create. This is one reason that a vast majority of
        my work is portraits. There is so much to see in a face, the life lived, the
        hope of life to come.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of my work are often a reflection
        of a world view shaped by my formative years in India and to the trials, tribulations
        and undulations of everyday life. Contributed in equal measure is my itinerant
        existence that has allowed me to perceive life with the fresh and enthusiastic
        eyes of a newborn seeing things for the first time; a world of color, vivid
        characters, swirling spaces and unconstrained energy.\r\n\r\nFinally, I paint
        as a means of telling my very own story; naive, melancholic and dreamy as
        it is. This is how I process and deal with emotion itself.","blog":"","city":"","created_at":"2011-09-26T13:57:25-07:00","facebook":"","flickr":"","id":526,"instagram":null,"lat":37.7486,"lng":-122.418,"max_pieces":20,"myspace":"","news":null,"open_studios_participation":"201404|201504","pinterest":null,"street":"","studionumber":"317","twitter":"","updated_at":"2015-03-16T09:45:21-07:00","zip":null}}},{"full_name":"JoAnn

        am the founder and CEO of Magic Sauce Media, a branding, social media and
        communications agency that puts companies and individuals on the map.\r\n\r\nHaving
        launched products and services from close to a dozen countries, I have been
        helping people and companies tell their story for twenty years. \r\n\r\nMagic
        Sauce Photography is a natural, visual and creative extension of Magic Sauce
        Media.\r\n\r\nI am also the founder and editor of We Blog the World, a blog
        network where nearly 200 writers contribute to a global community that covers
        every culture in the world.\r\n\r\nAs a self-taught photographer, I am still
        learning what sun, shade, wind, snow and rain can add to the images I capture
        on my trusty Canon 7D.\r\n\r\nAs you''ll see from exploring the galleries,
        my primary passion is shooting people. Regardless of whether I shoot someone
        on stage at a technology conference or in a market in rural South America,
        my hope is to bring forth their true essence, showing who they are rather
        than what they do. I also hope to highlight their cultural identity in a way
        that not only reflects who they are, but gives color to their journey and
        their life.\r\n\r\nWhile the photographs in my collection on Magic Sauce Photography,
        are only a small fraction of the tens of thousands of photos I have shot over
        the years, the globally-rich portfolio includes people, places and things
        from Europe, China, SE Asia, Australia, South America, East, North and Southern
        Africa, Central America, the Middle East, Canada and the U.S.\r\n\r\nFrom
        urban edge, architecture and markets to earth, stone, flowers and life as
        seen through the eyes of children, I try to tell a story, their story. I believe
        that we can make a positive impact on the world and the people suffering in
        it through storytelling, so whether it''s visual, audio or through the written
        word, listen to what you hear and share your story in any and every way you
        know how.\r\n\r\nJoin me on this visual journey and on Twitter @weblogtheworld,
        @magicsaucephoto and @magicsaucemedia. And, please become a fan on Facebook

        Leibenath''s artwork begins with experiencing a scene or moment and recording
        it through a series of photographs, drawings, and observations. These experiential
        sessions ignite new series of work. Back in the studio, Leibenath uses her
        direct visual recollection and her experiential memory to shape each piece
        based on the new body''s subject matter. She intuitively builds the paintings
        in layers, relying just as heavily on formal considerations as she does on
        the source material. The finished painting is a record of the painting process
        as well as an exploration of the subtle nuances of the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginally
        from Germany with a background in architecture and art, Leibenath has been
        painting in San Francisco since 2006. Her work is part of several private
        collections nationwide and has been exhibited in New York, Los Angeles, Miami,
        and Atlanta, in addition to San Francisco.","blog":"http://katjaleibenath.blogspot.com/","city":"SAN

        statement\r\n\r\nAondrea Maynard''s paintings are modern interpretations of
        Nature that explore the emotionally evocative power of color and light as
        seduction, invitation and sanctuary. \r\n\r\nThese Intimate pieces are inspired
        by old romantic European landscape paintings that represent a contemporary
        approach to old world sensibilities and our relationship as a metaphoric space
        between.  Work that honors the poetry of memory, calls on the lineage of wisdom
        sourced from the natural world and the history of our humanity in her more
        abstract expressions, while embracing the mysterious to reveal a landscape
        of serenity and repose that is ever-expansive, transformative, and inclusive.\r\n\r\nCV\r\nAondrea

        \r\n\r\nLiesa Johannssen was born in Berlin on January 13th, 1987.\r\nFrom
        an early age she was fascinated by the possibility of expressing human emotions
        through photography.\r\n\r\nHaving completed an internship at the age of 14,
        she followed this up with professional training in press photography.\r\n\r\nIn
        2005 Liesa became a staff photographer for the Photothek agency. It was during
        this period that she first came into contact with political photography.\r\n\r\nShe
        gained a sensibility for capturing exceptional moments mainly during her travels
        with the Foreign Minister and the President of Germany, having been given
        the freedom to capture her own unique view on moments.\r\n\r\nIn 2010 Liesa
        moved to Madrid, where she mainly worked on reportages about Spanish traditions
        and daily life while working as a freelance photographer for The Financial
        Times Germany.\r\n\r\nAfter two years of living in Spain, Liesa moved to San
        Francisco in 2012, where she continues to work as a freelance photographer
        across a number of fields.\r\n\r\nAlongside her day-to-day work, Liesa continues
        to explore the idea of finding her mission in art photography. \r\n\r\n1890

        a background in scientific illustration, Melissa Wagner\u2019s work uses a
        variety of methods and media to engage the natural world and illuminate its
        earthly remnants. A disparate falling of leaves, scattered branches, crushed
        shells, and dried ferns, emerge from a paintings surface to create organic
        three-dimensional works that incorporate intense color, texture, and a perpetually
        changing surface. Through her work, Melissa strives to examine and magnify
        the disguised processes that envelope the living world while addressing issues
        concerning reproduction and the environment. Mixing the products of nature
        themselves with glossy synthetic resin coats, Melissa playfully composes her
        vision of a world that harnesses natural subjects to construct new models
        where art, earth, science, and wonder intersect. Melissa draws her inspiration
        from her love of nature and extensive local and global travels.","blog":"http://wagnerpaintings.com/blog/","city":"San

        Statement\r\n\r\nMy photographic art practice transforms images of the mundane
        into the sublime. The ordinary is invisible; we see it and pass it by.  I
        make visible that which we take for granted. \r\n\r\nI am inspired by Wabi-sabi,
        a philosophy and aesthetic that comes from Japanese Buddhism. It is a beauty
        of things imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete; of things modest and humble;
        of things unconventional.   The temporal nature of existence runs throughout
        my work. My photographs question the value of labor, particularly \u201cwomen\u2019s
        work\u201d with respect to time.  Does this make me a feminist artist?  Perhaps.   \r\n\r\nWe
        live in a disposable culture that fetishizes the clean and the new.  I am
        fascinated by marks, traces and remnants and photograph them as a way to reference
        both time and personal narratives.  The vestiges left on objects communicate
        a particular person or person\u2019s interaction with them. They are specific
        and revealing, unique and historical, intimate and almost embarrassing.\r\n\r\nBiography\r\n\r\nVictoria
        Mara Heilweil is a nationally exhibited photographic artist, curator and educator.  She
        received her Masters of Fine Arts from California College of the Arts in 1995.  Her
        work has been included in exhibitions at Intersection for the Arts, Southern
        Exposure, RayKo Photo Center and Root Division in San Francisco, BC Space
        Gallery and the Robert V. Fullerton Art Museum in Southern California, the
        Minneapolis Photo Center, Perspective Fine Art in Evanston, IL, the Visual
        Arts Center in Portsmouth, VA and the Washington Square Art Galleries in New
        York City. In October 2013 Victoria had two solo exhibitions at the California
        State University Chico Art Gallery, and wall space gallery in Santa Barbara,
        CA.  She has also created public and community based art works in conjunction
        with the ZERO1 Bienniale in San Jose, CA and the Bayview Opera House in San
        Francisco, CA. \r\n\r\nVictoria is a founding member of MicroClimate Collective,
        an artist created curatorial project, which has produced ten exhibitions over
        the past five years. She is also an independent curator, whose recent exhibition,
        Edible Ephemera, examined the fleeting temporal nature of food through artworks
        utilizing transmutation to create a more permanent state. The exhibition was
        held at Root Division in San Francisco during the month of April, 2013.\r\n\r\nIn
        addition to her exhibition and curatorial history, Victoria has taught the
        past 18 years at colleges and community centers.   \r\n","blog":"","city":"","created_at":"2014-03-16T20:21:53-07:00","facebook":"www.facebook.com/Victoria.Heilweil.Artist","flickr":"","id":905,"instagram":null,"lat":null,"lng":null,"max_pieces":20,"myspace":"","news":null,"open_studios_participation":"201404|201410","pinterest":null,"street":"","studionumber":"211","twitter":"","updated_at":"2014-09-04T17:17:39-07:00","zip":null}}},{"full_name":"Paule

        work is less about recording what I see around me and more about exploring
        what \u0003I cannot see. I make art to articulate through the visual what
        we struggle to articulate through language; to reflect what lies beneath the
        rational mind.\r\n\r\nThe series I created titled Nothing Left to Break, is
        based on the theme of impermanence. The idea is that everything is already
        broken from the start, and that there is freedom in letting go and accepting
        it as it is, broken. Through work like this, I am exploring the ways in which
        we connect to this freedom. I often use gravity as a theme, thinking about
        how gravity grounds us in the physical realm, but wondering what grounds us
        metaphysically. I believe the external noise of modern culture disconnects
        us from our internal quiet which in turn distracts us from exploring these
        questions. My hope is to create work that allows the viewer to tap into this
        quiet.\r\n\r\nMy process of creating art reflects this. Choosing a wood panel
        with lines and imperfections that speak to me, creating order by limiting
        color and shape, and attempting to manipulate gravity compositionally in a
        way that feels rhythmic and melodic. I am drawn to transparency in the paint
        and materials because of its ability \u0003to reveal what is underneath, mirroring
        themes I am exploring. Through this process \u0003of limiting color and opaqueness,
        I am allowing the empty to take importance; \u0003defining through absence
        rather than presence \u2013 permitting the quiet to be heard.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIO\r\n\r\nBased

        faux deities grace my neon-saturated collages.  Flanked by flowers, clippings,
        monuments both contemporary and ancient, glitter, gold, and altar \u201ctchotchkes\u201d,
        generous praise is invited for these mysterious women.  They start as models,
        friends, and muses, but then, from a photo, they become frozen in a chance
        glance or a raw moment of ecstasy.  They transform into an expression of divinity
        that is at once both intensely personal and universal -- from the ordinary
        into an object worthy of devotion.\r\n \r\nDrawing inspiration from Medieval
        Christian iconography, Eastern religious shrines, and Mexican Catholic altars
        -- as well as Neo-psychedelic rock, 60''s gurus, and religious cults -- I
        fling traditional belief to the floor in favor of creating my own new gods,
        goddesses, and gurus.  My own religion.  \r\n \r\n \r\nThe goddesses and gurus
        I depict are now members of my own personal Heavenly Host of religious icons.  There
        are infinite things to worship -- many of them ironic coincidences-- for which
        my deities are named. I have always been fascinated with the myriad qualities
        that exist in a single moment or thought -- and parallel to that, the myriad
        which exist in a single personality or seemingly simple object.  It''s all
        a little Gothic, in the classical sense -- the tragic comedy, the swooning
        romance entrenched in violence, the newlywed couple who fight on vacation.  Those
        moments, those dueling realities, are the spice of life.  And in my expression,
        they''re embodied in deities that are themselves a mash-up of apparently opposite
        styles -- the old and the new, the traditional and the outlandish.\r\n \r\nThe
        journey now continues, as all spiritual journeys do.  The more I look around,
        the more I walk the earth and find new things to worship, the more gods, goddesses
        and gurus will be added to my personal mythology.  Armed with a fire in my
        belly and a camera in my hand, I''m off to share my self-made religion with
        the masses, so they may pay reverence to lavish reality right along with me.","blog":"","city":"San

        irrelevant and unrelated events have led me to explore photography as a creative
        way to absorb, process, and express my experiences.  I am interested in recognizing,
        exposing and celebrating beauty and composition I see everywhere everyday,
        although I feel deep anxiety and can get emotionally overwhelmed thinking
        about and trying to reconcile the lack of ownership and responsibility reflected
        in Waste and Destruction.  For example, about 15 years ago, I discovered my
        love of seeing and photographing close up abstracts on the street of rust,
        litter, cracks, peeling paint, etc.  Since then, I''ve been passionately drawn
        to and see beauty in derelict, decrepit, disintegrating, decomposing, forgotten,
        and damaged subjects. Seeing these from a new perspective becomes an exciting
        adventure, and when I focus on what is right in front of me instead of the
        \u201cBig Picture,\u201d it''s not overwhelming, but soothing.\r\n\r\nSunrise?  As
        an independent artist, I periodically found (find?) it challenging to get
        out of bed in the morning at a reasonably timely hour in order to be a constructive
        member of society.  But I have discovered that I LOVE waking up, going somewhere,
        photographing, and sharing my experience of watching the sunrise, which has
        become something about which I have always heard rumors, but which always
        seemed to elude me: a calling.","blog":"http://scott-fin.tumblr.com/","city":"","created_at":"2015-02-26T15:03:13-08:00","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/Scottfin.photography","flickr":"","id":963,"instagram":"","lat":null,"lng":null,"max_pieces":20,"myspace":"","news":null,"open_studios_participation":"201504","pinterest":"","street":"","studionumber":"210","twitter":"","updated_at":"2015-03-06T10:15:08-08:00","zip":null}}},{"full_name":"Aynur
